# RedditIncelAnalysis
This research uses subreddit activity data to detect and classify users who may be at risk of isolation within the incel community. By analyzing user behavior and engagement patterns, I developed a classification model that can identify individuals who are getting funneled to incel-related subreddits, potentially indicating a higher risk of isolation and exposure to harmful ideologies.
